# commoncoldwar
Common Cold War was developed for a college assignment. The assignment required us to design and develop a 2D space shooter game for the Android platform. The player must shoot their way through 3 levels, defeating a unique boss at the end of each level. The levels scale up in difficulty as the game progresses. The game features multiple enemies that have their own behaviors and weapons. The player can use Power Ups to improve their chances of success. The gameplay focuses on dodging hazards, picking up Power Ups and blasting enemies.

I am happy with the result but plan on coming back to the game and creating my own Sprites and Animations. As such, the game is currently in a private state on the Android Store. Please email me for an invitation if you wish to play it.
